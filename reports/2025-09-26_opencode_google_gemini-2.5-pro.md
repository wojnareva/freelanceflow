# Bug Fix Report - 2025-09-26

## Summary

This report details the fixes for several localization bugs found during manual testing of the FreelanceFlow application. The root cause of all bugs was hardcoded English text or incorrect date formatting that didn't account for the application's locale.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Untranslated Month Names in Time-Tracking Calendar

-   **Root Cause:** The calendar was using Carbon's `translatedFormat()` method, which was not correctly configured for Czech month names.
-   **Files Modified:**
    -   `app/Livewire/TimeTracking/TimeEntriesCalendar.php`
    -   `resources/lang/cs/time-tracking.php` (created)
-   **Fix:**
    1.  Modified the `render` method in `TimeEntriesCalendar.php` to use a custom translation key for the month name.
    2.  Created a new translation file `time-tracking.php` with the Czech month names.
-   **Testing:** Manually verified that the calendar now displays the correct Czech month names.
-   **Potential Side Effects:** None anticipated.

### 2. Untranslated Text in Time-Tracking Filters and Tables

-   **Root Cause:** The filters and table headers in the time-tracking list view contained hardcoded English text.
-   **Files Modified:**
    -   `resources/views/livewire/time-tracking/time-entries-list.blade.php`
    -   `resources/lang/cs/time-tracking.php`
-   **Fix:**
    1.  Replaced all hardcoded strings in the Blade file with Laravel's `__` translation helper.
    2.  Added the corresponding Czech translations to the `time-tracking.php` language file.
-   **Testing:** Manually verified that all filters, table headers, and other text elements in the time-tracking list are now correctly translated into Czech.
-   **Potential Side Effects:** None anticipated.

### 3. Untranslated Month Names in Dashboard Chart

-   **Root Cause:** The dashboard's revenue chart was formatting month names using Carbon's `format()` method, which defaults to English.
-   **Files Modified:**
    -   `app/Livewire/Dashboard/RevenueChart.php`
-   **Fix:**
    1.  Modified the `loadChartData` method in `RevenueChart.php` to use `translatedFormat('M Y')` with the application's current locale.
-   **Testing:** Manually verified that the dashboard chart now displays abbreviated Czech month names.
-   **Potential Side Effects:** None anticipated.
