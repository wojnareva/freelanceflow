# Bug Report Template - Manual Testing

## Instructions for AI Agent

**Before fixing any bugs, please follow these steps:**

1. **Read the project structure:** If you find `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` in the main directory, read it to understand the codebase architecture
2. **Create a todo list:** For each bug you plan to fix, create a structured todo list with specific tasks
3. **Fix systematically:** Work through bugs one by one, testing your changes
4. **Report your work:** When finished, provide a brief summary of how you fixed each bug, including:
   - What was the root cause
   - What files were modified
   - What testing was performed
   - Any potential side effects to watch for
5. **Create report file:** Create a `reports` folder if it doesn't exist, then create an MD file with your results in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_[your_model_name].md` (e.g., `2025-01-15_claude-3-5-sonnet.md`)

**Bug Priority Guidelines:**
- Fix Critical bugs first (app crashes, data loss)
- Then High priority (main functionality broken)
- Medium and Low priority bugs can be addressed last
