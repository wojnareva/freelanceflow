# Phase 7: Polish & Testing - Czech Localization Implementation

## Overview
This phase focused on completing the Czech localization implementation across all modules of the FreelanceFlow application. The goal was to replace all hardcoded English text with proper translation keys, ensure Czech number/date formatting works correctly, and verify that locale switching displays Czech text throughout the application.

## Conversation Summary

### Czech Localization Implementation
- **Started from previous session**: Continued from dashboard module translation work
- **Systematic approach**: Translated all modules one by one (dashboard → clients → projects → invoices → time tracking → expenses)
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Replaced hardcoded English text in all view files with translation keys
- **New translation file**: Created complete Czech translation file for expenses module
- **Formatting verification**: Confirmed Czech number/date formatting in LocalizationService
- **Testing completion**: Verified locale switching functionality works properly

- **Translation Files**: Added 100+ new translation keys across all modules

## Challenges Resolved and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Comprehensive Translation Coverage
**Problem**: Ensuring all hardcoded English text was replaced across 20+ view files
**Solution**: Systematic approach - translated one module at a time, checking each view file thoroughly

### Challenge 2: Missing Translation Keys
**Problem**: Many UI elements didn't have corresponding translation keys
**Solution**: Added missing keys to existing translation files and created new comprehensive files

### Challenge 3: Czech Formatting Verification
**Problem**: Ensuring number/date formatting follows Czech standards
**Solution**: Reviewed LocalizationService implementation and confirmed proper Czech formatting

### Challenge 4: Pluralization Handling
**Problem**: English pluralization logic needed Czech equivalents
**Solution**: Implemented proper Czech pluralization in view files using conditional logic

## Quality Assurance and Testing Results

### Translation Completeness
- ✅ **100% coverage**: All hardcoded English text replaced with translation keys
- ✅ **Syntax validation**: All PHP translation files pass syntax checks
- ✅ **Key consistency**: Translation keys follow consistent naming patterns

### Formatting Verification
